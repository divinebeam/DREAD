    IDEAS
        power regens too fast
        ultras and mutas too powerful
        ping nests when theres 5 left
        show cost of dead players
        some nests should be defended by buildings
        maybe nests should spawn enemies when they take damage
        infested terrans should be more punishing like limit vision
        camera follow toggle
        agility should be more useful
